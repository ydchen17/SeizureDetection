# Seizure Detection

PCA-based and raw input-based are in seperate files. The FFT part is adapted from https://github.com/leeyunfai/Predicting_Epilepsy/blob/master/EpilepsyFFT.ipynb, where a variety of FFT-based wave analysis is made. Lasso-based feature selection is made to select important features and then models are trained with the selected features.
