# Seizure Detection

PCA-based and raw data-based are in seperate files. Note that the FFT part is adapted from a previous work accessible at https://github.com/leeyunfai/Predicting_Epilepsy/blob/master/EpilepsyFFT.ipynb and we further use Lasso for feature selection. Also we fix some bugs in the original work and train machine learning classifiers with the features.
